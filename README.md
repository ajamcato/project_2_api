## General Assembly: SEI Project 2 (Full Stack Project)
The purpose of this application will serve as tool for coaches to add NBA prospect
basketball players to their team roster. This application will enable users to input
details about each basketball player within their account.

## Planning Story
The goal of this project was to build one to many tables using full stack web applications. The user will be able to create, update, and delete. The first step of building the full stack web application started with creating the authentification forms for the API. My next approach consisted of connecting the backend to an API by creating the CRUD action so that the user is able to create their personal account. Once that was completed, I used curl scripts to test each functionality to be sure it was working properly before I began working on the front end of the project.
